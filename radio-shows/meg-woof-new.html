                    Recorded in September 2020, this broadcast was put together
                    to highlight the creative resolve of underground
                    experimental music communities since the beginning of the
                    pandemic.

                    Artists and facilitators have adapted in many ways:
                    musicians have self-released tracks recorded in isolation,
                    streamed performances from their homes and embarked on
                    remote collaborations; venues have started digital imprints
                    and organised online events; independent labels have put
                    together benefit compilations. This show presents a
                    selection of tracks from the heartening abundance of
                    independent experimental music that has been released into
                    the world in the face of intense new challenges and
                    restrictions.
