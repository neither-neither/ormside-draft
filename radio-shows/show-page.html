            </header>
            <p>
              Recorded in September 2020, this broadcast was put together to
              highlight the creative resolve of underground experimental music
              communities since the beginning of the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artists and facilitators have adapted in many ways: musicians have
              self-released tracks recorded in isolation, streamed performances
              from their homes and embarked on remote collaborations; venues
              have started digital imprints and organised online events;
              independent labels have put together benefit compilations. This
              show presents a selection of tracks from the heartening abundance
              of independent experimental music that has been released into the
              world in the face of intense new challenges and restrictions.
