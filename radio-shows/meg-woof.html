                    Recorded in September 2020, this broadcast was put together
                    to highlight the creative resolve of underground
                    experimental music communities since the beginning of the
                    pandemic.
                    <br />

                    Artists and facilitators have adapted in many ways:
                    musicians have self-released tracks recorded in isolation,
                    streamed performances from their homes and embarked on
                    remote collaborations; venues have started digital imprints
                    and organised online events; independent labels have put
                    together benefit compilations. This show presents a
                    selection of tracks from the heartening abundance of
                    independent experimental music that has been released into
                    the world in the face of intense new challenges and
                    restrictions.
