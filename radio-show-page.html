                  “Who is experimental music?” is not an obvious question; the
                  syntax doesn’t quite scan. But then, Inga Copeland (formerly
                  one half of lo-fi weirdo-pop duo Hype Williams, alongside Dean
                  Blunt) has never been much interested in taking the obvious
                  route. And her self-released album Who is experimental music?
                  is as opaque as we have come to expect from the UK
                  musician—even if it does seem to come embedded with elementary
                  questions that might guide its reception. I’m thinking in
                  particular of the second track, “Good or bad,” which attaches
                  that binary value judgment to a dry swirl of manipulated voice
                  that stops and starts, gallops and stutters, in an off-kilter
                  rhythm whose structure is largely elusive. Copeland has
                  previously shown that she knows her way around a song. The
                  Lolina project, though, has always had more to do with the
                  song’s dissolution: bare-bones, stretched-out synth-and-vocal
                  drafts that bear half-cooked traces of club tropes.
